But Nuxt is designed for building applications, while VuePress is more lightweight and focused on content-centric static sites.</p><h3 id="vitepress"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vitepress">#</a> VitePress</h3><p>VitePress is the little brother of VuePress. It&#39;s also created and maintained by our Vue.js team. It&#39;s even more lightweight and faster than VuePress. However, as a tradeoff, it&#39;s more opinionated and less configurable. For example, it does not support plugins. But VitePress is powerful enough to make your content online if you don&#39;t need advanced customizations.</p><p>It might not be an appropriate comparison, but you can take VuePress and VitePress as Laravel and Lumen.</p><h3 id="docsify-docute"><a class="header-anchor" href="#docsify-docute">#</a> Docsify / Docute</h3><p>Both are great projects and also Vue-powered. Except they are both fully runtime-driven and therefore not SEO-friendly. If you don’t care for SEO and don’t want to mess with installing dependencies, these are still great choices.</p><h3 id="hexo"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hexo">#</a> Hexo</h3><p>Hexo has been serving the Vue 2.x docs well. The biggest problem is that its theming system is static and string-based - we want to take advantage of Vue for both the layout and the interactivity. Also, Hexo’s Markdown rendering isn’t the most flexible to configure.</p><h3 id="gitbook"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gitbook">#</a> GitBook</h3><p>We’ve been using GitBook for most of our sub project docs. The primary problem with GitBook is that its development reload performance is intolerable with a large amount of files. The default theme also has a pretty limiting navigation structure, and the theming system is, again, not Vue based. The team behind GitBook is also more focused on turning it into a commercial product rather than an open-source tool.</p>',12),D={render:function(e,t){const o=(0,r.up)("OutboundLink");return(0,r.wg)(),(0,r.j4)(r.HY,null,[n,(0,r.Wm)("p",null,[a,(0,r.Wm)("a",s,[i,(0,r.Wm)(o)]),l]),d,h,(0,r.Wm)("p",null,[u,(0,r.Wm)("a",c,[p,(0,r.Wm)(o)]),m,(0,r.Wm)("a",g,[f,(0,r.Wm)(o)]),k]),(0,r.Wm)("p",null,[w,(0,r.Wm)("a",b,[y,(0,r.Wm)(o)]),v]),V,(0,r.Wm)("p",null,[W,(0,r.Wm)("a",x,[P,(0,r.Wm)(o)]),U,j,H,(0,r.Wm)("a",T,[I,(0,r.Wm)(o)]),B]),M],64)}}},2169:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{data:()=>r});const r={key:"v-e6412400",path:"/en/guide/",title:"Introduction",frontmatter:{},excerpt:"",headers:[{level:2,title:"How It Works",slug:"how-it-works",children:[]},{level:2,title:"Why Not ...?",slug:"why-not",children:[{level:3,title:"Nuxt",slug:"nuxt",children:[]},{level:3,title:"VitePress",slug:"vitepress",children:[]},{level:3,title:"Docsify / Docute",slug:"docsify-docute",children:[]},{level:3,title:"Hexo",slug:"hexo",children:[]},{level:3,title:"GitBook",slug:"gitbook",children:[]}]}],filePathRelative:"en/guide/README.md",git:{updatedTime:1612069518e3,contributors:[]}}}}]);
